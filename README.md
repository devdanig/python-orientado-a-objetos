# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository is a personal learning space focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python, applying best practices, clean design, and real-world modeling. The main goal is to practice OOP concepts through executable Python code, keeping conceptual notes outside the repository and using GitHub as a place for reusable, runnable, and well-structured examples.

## What You’ll Find Here
* **Practical Python examples** applying Object-Oriented Programming.
* Code organized around **real OOP concepts**, not isolated theory.
* A progressive system modeled around a **library management domain**.
* **Clean, readable, and maintainable** Python code.
* Modular structure designed for scalability and future refactoring.

---

## OOP Concepts Covered
This repository focuses on mastering core and advanced OOP concepts in Python:
* **Classes and Objects**
* **Constructors** (`__init__`)
* **Instance methods** and special methods (`__str__`)
* **Encapsulation** with private attributes and properties (`@property`)
* **Inheritance** to reduce code duplication
* **Polymorphism** using interfaces and protocols
* **Composition** over inheritance
* **Abstract Base Classes** (`ABC`, `@abstractmethod`)
* **Static and class methods**
* **Exception handling** (`try`, `except`, `raise`)
* **Object serialization** and persistence using JSON

## Repository Philosophy
1. **Executable Code First:** This repository contains runnable Python code, not just explanations.
2. **Concept-Based Structure:** Each folder represents a specific OOP concept or responsibility.
3. **Clarity Over Complexity:** Files are intentionally small and readable.
4. **Scalable Design:** Code is written with extensibility and maintainability in mind.

---

## Virtual Environments
All examples assume the use of a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated and portable.

**1. Create a virtual environment:**
`python -m venv venv`

**2. Activate it:**
* **Windows:** `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
* **macOS / Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`

**3. Deactivate:**
`deactivate`

*Note: The `venv/` folder is ignored via `.gitignore` and should never be committed.*

## Code Style & Best Practices
Although the main focus is OOP, this repository also applies general Python best practices:
* Clear and meaningful naming.
* Responsibility-driven class design.
* Separation of concerns.
* Minimal coupling between components.
* Explicit error handling.

## How to Use This Repo
1. **Clone the repository:**
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-oop.git`
2. **Navigate to the project:** `cd python-oop`
3. **Create and activate** a virtual environment.
4. **Explore each folder** by concept and run the scripts.
5. **Modify, break, refactor, and rebuild** — learning happens there.

## Future Additions
* Refactoring examples applying **SOLID principles**.
* **Design patterns** implemented in Python.
* Larger mini-projects using the same domain.
* Type hints and static analysis improvements.
